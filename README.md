# kodi_lcddisplay
A Kodi LCD display controller for viewing media information

## Prerequisite
You must use an LCD display that is supported by the Serdisp library.
This add-on has been developed using Kodi provided by the Openelec distribution.
For the moment, only monochromatic displays are officially supported by this add-on.

## Installation
Simply zip the folder content and make it reachable from your Kodi installation.
From kodi menu, install it as an add-on and choose "Install from zip file".
If asked, enable installation from unknown sources so Kodi can install the add-on.
Browse through the filesystem and select the zip file.

## Configuration
Navigate through Kodi menus and look for the configuration of the add-on. This can be found among the "Service" type of add-ons.
You can fill the configuration tab with the display size in pixels, the font size and the time slot where the display backlight is switched off.
In the configuration tab, you can also choose the font to be used, for the moment, only 2 are supported, but I am working on it so it will further be possible to choose a font provided by the system.
Don't forget to enable the add-on inthe configuration tab.

## Troubleshoot
If any error appear, simply deactivate the add-on and activate it again through the Kodi menu. You can also reboot the Kodi installation.
